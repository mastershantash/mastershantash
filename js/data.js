            "detail":"Phoenix is a UHV magnetron deposition system ideal for the research laboratories involved in thin-film research. With its four fixed angle (60o), confocal, 2-inch magnetron guns combined with a rotating z-axis substrate manipulator, the system is capable of depositing multilayer or alloy thin films. PID controlled substrate heating up to a temperature of 800°C caters to most of the alloy deposition requirements. A UHV load lock system with a magnetically coupled substrate manipulator arm helps in loading and unloading the substrates without breaking the vacuum in the main chamber. The system has an optical port for in-situ laser interferometry-based stress measurements on the growing films. Additional ports for standard instruments like quartz crystal thickness monitors and electrical feed-throughs are also available.",

The system can accommodate both OPAL-I and OPAL-II range of magnetron sputtering guns. To keep the operation simple and costs in check, the system is fully manual controlled but can be automated if required. An HV load lock system with a magnetically coupled substrate manipulator provides easy substrate change capabilities without disturbing the vacuum of the main deposition chamber. Option for PID controlled substrate heating up to a temperature of 800°C is available. The z-axis substrate manipulator can accommodate up to four different shadow masks. Easy in-situ mask alignment required between different layers of a device can be performed under a high vacuum. View port is provided above each magnetron guns for precise alignment of the substrate over the guns.",
